# Papers Summary
* [Neural nets tips and tricks](https://github.com/manas1iitr/PapersSummary/blob/master/NeuralNetsTipsAndTricks)

Summary of papers (mainly in NLP and Machine Learning) that I read:

* [Structured Pruning of Bert based Question Answering model](https://github.com/manas1iitr/PapersSummary/blob/master/Structured%20Pruning%20of%20a%20BERT-based%20Question%20Answering%20Model)
* [Batch Normalization](https://github.com/manas1iitr/PapersSummary/blob/master/BatchNorm.pdf) (The summation sign over the mini-batch size is important while computing the derivatives of mean and variance of mini-batch, which in turn are required for computing the derivative with respect to a particular x_i)
