Adam optimizer for training (more stable training, eliminates hyperparameters like learning rate)
Xavier or He initialization
ReLu activation function (helps in faster training by helping with flow of gradients)
Batch normalization or layer normalization (helps in making the training more stable, also regularization)
Dropout (regularization)
